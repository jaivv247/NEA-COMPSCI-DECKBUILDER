Hello there! This is my NEA for my computer science alevel, ther version you should currrently be on is the broken GUI version where inputs and outputs will be prompted on to you
This is meant to be a Deck builder for the popular card game yugioh that uses parameters native to the game (see the list in the program to learn them) and corresponding varaible to those parameters (i would advise searching up stuff like levels of cards or you can just use name for the blue eye white dragon lol) 
I tried my best :) and I would love to hear the reviews and bugs you may find anyways thanks for reading and using this program god speed to you soldier :D


BTW IF USING THIS VERSION PLEASE DOWNLOAD DEARPYGUI
